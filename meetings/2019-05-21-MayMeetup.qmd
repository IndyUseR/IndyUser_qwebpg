## Abstract

Discrete event simulation is a powerful approach to model real life processes that consist of a sequence of discrete events. An example of such system is queue in a coffee shop. We will explore the package simmer and work through some examples from the vignettes to learn how simmer can be used for doing discrete event simulation in R.
