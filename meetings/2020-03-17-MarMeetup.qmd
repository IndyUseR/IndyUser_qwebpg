## Abstract

Join us for two presentation.
1. Vijay Lulla will be leading us in an exploration of the unexpected parts of the R language in a round of R Trivia!
2. Derrick Kearney will share usage scenarios for renv, an R package that helps create portable and reproducible development environments. The package author, Kevin Ushey, explains the basics in his [video](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/renv-project-environments-for-r-kevin-ushey). We'll build on top of it with practical usage examples.
