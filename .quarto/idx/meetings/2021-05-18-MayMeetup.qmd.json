Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package `arrow`. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package `arrow`, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark.\n\n## Links\n[Meetup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXbq4OYtsFA)\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2021-05-18-MayMeetup.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"cosmo","title":"Apache Arrow: Enabling Data Engineering in R - Ian Cook","slug":"may2021","date":"2021-05-18"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
