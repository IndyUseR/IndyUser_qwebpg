The abstract of the talk, Ryan's profile and link to presented material are below.\n\n\nR is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.\n\n## Profile of speaker Ryan Wade:\nI am a data analytic professional with over 20 years of experience. My education and work experience enables me to understand things from a technical, analytical, and business viewpoint. I have the ability to present complex data in an intuitive way using sound analytical and visualization methods.\n\nI have an advanced analytical and technical skill-set. My technical background includes the following tools and programming languages: Power BI, T-SQL, Excel, DAX, R, M, Python, VBA, Office 365, SSIS, SSAS Tabular & SSRS. I also have an elementary understanding of Azure ML and Octave.\n\nI am a data analytics enthusiast and I have spoken at R meetups, Python meetups, SQLSaturdays, and PASS Summit about various topics dealing with data analytic\n\n[Link to material from talk]()"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2018-04-17-AprilMeetup.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"cosmo","title":"Using R in Power BI - Ryan Wade","slug":"apr2018","date":"2018-04-17"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
