In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level."

Lately, there’s been an explosion of new R packages that allow us to take these data tables and make them presentable in publication contexts. A package Rich Iannone has been working on, called gt, is great for taking a data frame and making it look good (and more like a table you’d find on the web or in print). Rich will show us some examples of how the gt package works, where it works well, and where other packages might do better for specific needs. This introduction will help prepare you to try out gt and some of the other table-making packages in the R ecosystem."

    "text": "The job of a data engineer is to build, manage, and optimize systems for transforming data into forms that facilitate analysis. Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package arrow. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package arrow, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark."
